# OpenLink
[NeoLink's](https://googol.neocities.org/neolink/) source code, but it's public and can be edited.

## Why?
Most of the ad services on Neocities ([BannerLink](https://wsmz.gay/#misc-bannerlink), [NavLink](https://dimden.dev/navlinkads/), [ButtonLink](https://anoldnet.ichi.city/button-link/)) are based on NeoLink's source code.

I made it open-source because I want it to be open for user contributions without needing to send an E-Mail to a webmaster just to add you to the ad service, and because I want other people to make their own ad services as well!

You can also check out [Linkshuffle](https://dabric.neocities.org/post/linkshuffle) if you want!

## Guidelines
To get accepted into OpenLink, you must adhere to the following:

* You must have a website. If not, then [go make one](https://pages.github.com)!
* Your site must not contain any bigotory or CP.
* If your site is NSFW, please use content warning that informs users before entering your site.
* No crypto.
* Commercial sites are prohibited too.
* Don't use a site builder (WYSIWYG editors and static site generators are fine).
* Do not use AI in your site. You may use AI as a learning tool but that doesn't mean you have to make an entire site with it.

## Embedding
To embed it, here's the sample code:

```
<iframe width="180" height="180" style="border:none" src="https://fazlabz-dev.github.io/openlink/embed.html" name="neolink"></iframe>
```

<iframe width="180" height="180" style="border:none" src="https://fazlabz-dev.github.io/openlink/embed.html" name="neolink"></iframe>

> NOTE: You can change the width and height of the embed if you want!

## Contributing
To add a site, simply [fork](https://github.com/fazlabz-dev/openlink/fork), add links to your site and the ad image, and then make a pull request!

The image must be placed either on the repo's `img/` folder, or using a file host to avoid hotlinking on free Neocities sites.

## Note
OpenLink, as well as it's base and the countless modifications are not commercial. Meaning you can't make money from it, sorry about that!

Think of it as an image-based webring.
